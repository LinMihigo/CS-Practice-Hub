Welcome to my CS Practice Hub! This is a dedicated space where I share my journey of learning and practicing Computer Science. The projects you'll find here are a mix of different technologies and concepts I've been exploring.

## 📚 What's Inside?

This repository is a collection of practice projects and scripts, including:
- Udemy React course by Stephen Grider
- Simple C scripts
- PostgreSQL scipts
- API play
- React-Redux-Practice

## 🎯 Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to document my learning journey and to provide a resource for anyone else on a similar path. Feel free to explore, use, and learn from these projects and scripts.

## 📖 How to Use

Each project or script has its own dedicated folder. Inside, you'll find the source code and a README file explaining the purpose of the project/script and how to run it.

Note: Please note that i haven't gotten around to adding Readme's to all projects.

## 🙏 Feedback

I'm always open to feedback and suggestions. If you have any ideas on how I can improve these projects or what I should explore next, please feel free to raise an issue.

Happy Tsoding! 🎉
