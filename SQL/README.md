# Celestial Bodies Database Script

This repository contains a PostgreSQL script that I wrote to pass the FreeCodeCamp Celestial Bodies Database exercise. The script is designed to interact with a database of celestial bodies, allowing users to perform various operations such as adding, updating, and deleting records.

## Features

- **Adding Records**: The script allows you to add new celestial bodies to the database.
- **Updating Records**: You can update the details of existing celestial bodies in the database.
- **Deleting Records**: The script also allows you to delete celestial bodies from the database.

## Getting Started

To get started with this script, you need to have PostgreSQL installed on your system. If you haven't installed it yet, you can download it from the [official PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

Once you have PostgreSQL installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
bash => git clone https://github.com/LinMihigo/CS-Practice-Hub.git
```


After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and run the script using the following command:


## Usage

To use the script, you need to connect to the PostgreSQL database using the `psql` command. Once connected, you can run the script using the `\i` command followed by the script file name.

```bash \i script.sql```


## Feedback

If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
